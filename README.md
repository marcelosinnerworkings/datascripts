# Docker containers that perform data tasks

## What is it?

This repository contains Dockerfiles that, once run, perform tasks related to data. Its focus is on data engineering activities, such as ETL/ELT, data integration, etc., but other goals may occur in the future.

The aim is to facilitate everyday tasks that would otherwise be cumbersome or not very intuitive.

## Why?

Although Docker containers require some initial learning from their users, they execute data tasks and applications in a very straightforward, practical manner. For this reason, they are simple and helpful as a solution to reduce the amount of time dealing with long configurations or application complexity.

## What is the tech stack?

The stack comprises:

* Python (and some of its libraries)
* Docker
